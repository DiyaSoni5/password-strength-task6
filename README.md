## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Passwords should be **at least 12 characters** long.
- Use a combination of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special characters**.
- Avoid using names, birthdates, or common phrases.
- Random strings or **passphrases** are more secure.
- It's safer to use a **password manager** to store complex passwords.
- **Do not reuse passwords** across different websites.

## 🛡️ Types of Attacks You Should Know

| Attack Type             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Brute-force**         | Systematically guesses every combination. Stronger passwords hold up better. |
| **Dictionary attack**   | Uses common words and phrases. Avoid using real words. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses passwords leaked from other sites. |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake sites or emails. |

## ✅ Conclusion

> After testing different passwords, it’s clear that length, complexity, and unpredictability are key. The strongest password tested (`T!r9#xBv2@`) could take over **12,000 years** to crack, whereas a common one like `Admin@1234` would fail in **under a second**.
